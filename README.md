### Frontend README (Vue.js/Nuxt.js)

# Tour Booking App - Frontend

This is the frontend for the Tour Booking application built using **Nuxt.js** and **Vue.js**.

### Functionality Overview

- **Home Page**: View available tours and browse the list.
- **Tour Booking**: Select a tour and proceed with the booking process.
- **Ticket Generation**: Once a booking is completed, view the generated ticket.

### Admin Features

- **Tour Management**: Admins can add, edit, or delete tours.
- **Booking Management**: Admins can view all user bookings.
- **Ticket Management**: Admins can access all generated tickets.
- **User Management**: Admins can manage user roles and permissions (Visit `/admin` to see admin links).

### State Management

We use the `useState()` hook from Nuxt for efficient state management across the application.

### API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend APIs using **Axios** for most requests, and **fetch()** in some cases to leverage Nuxtâ€™s built-in caching.
